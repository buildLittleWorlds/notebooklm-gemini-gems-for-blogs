    <h2>The Post We're Learning From</h2>

      <div class="excerpt-meta">
        <strong>Zay Amaro</strong> — "Markets, Metrics, and the Myth of Certainty" — January 26, 2026
      </div>
      <p>In his post "Trading on Reality with Kalshi," Caleb Murphy explains how prediction markets allow people to trade on the outcome of real-world events. Caleb describes Kalshi as a place where "knowledge is power," and where the collective wisdom of the market creates a price for the future.</p>
      <p>But as a sports fan, this brings me back to my favorite question: <strong>Can we ever truly trade on the unpredictable?</strong>...</p>
      <p>In the NFL, the "market" often gets it wrong because it cannot account for the "intentionality" that Gabriel Bell wrote about or the "grit" that Tom Bishop highlighted in boxing. A prediction market might say a team is "dead," but the market doesn't know the character of the locker room...</p>

    <h3>Why This Post Is Perfect for Learning Gems</h3>

    <p>Zay's post demonstrates the exact pattern a Peer Response Coach Gem should produce:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear peer summary:</strong> Fairly represents Caleb Murphy's argument about prediction markets</li>
      <li><strong>Personal expertise:</strong> Brings sports analytics knowledge (NFL, Super Bowl comebacks)</li>
      <li><strong>Network connections:</strong> References Gabriel Bell on "intentionality" and Tom Bishop on "grit"</li>
      <li><strong>Thesis with evidence:</strong> "Black Swan" events defeat market predictions, with specific example (Super Bowl LI)</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent voice:</strong> Thoughtful, engaged, integrates faith perspective naturally</li>
    </ul>

      <div class="step-content">
        <p>Before building the Gem, let's identify the structure:</p>

        <table class="tool-table">

              <th>Section</th>

              <td>Opening</td>
              <td>Summarizes Caleb's argument fairly, then pivots to his own question</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Connection</td>
              <td>Relates the topic to his domain (sports analytics)</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Analysis</td>
              <td>Introduces concept ("Black Swan") with specific example (Super Bowl LI)</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Network Weave</td>
              <td>References other bloggers (Gabriel, Tom, Sam) to build conversation</td>

              <td>Integrates personal perspective (faith) while affirming peer's contribution</td>

      <span class="step-title">Create the Peer Response Coach Gem</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>Go to Gemini → Gem manager → New Gem. Name it: <code>Peer Response Coach</code></p>

        <p>Paste these instructions:</p>

        <pre>You are my peer response writing coach for ENGL 170. When I share a peer's post, help me through these steps:

1. SUMMARIZE: State the peer's main argument in 2-3 sentences. Be charitable—represent them fairly, as Zay does with Caleb.

2. STEELMAN: What's the strongest version of their argument? What would make it even more convincing?

3. MY ANGLE: Ask me what domain expertise or personal knowledge I bring (like Zay brings sports knowledge). Help me connect it to their argument.

4. THESIS OPTIONS: Generate 2 possible thesis statements:
   - One that builds on their argument (agreement with extension)
   - One that challenges a specific assumption (respectful pushback)

5. NETWORK CONNECTIONS: Suggest ways to reference other bloggers in the network. "Who else has written about similar themes?"

6. EVIDENCE GAPS: What claims would need outside sources? What specific examples (like Zay's Super Bowl reference) would strengthen my argument?

7. OUTLINE: Create a 5-section structure:
   - Opening (peer summary + my question)
   - My expertise/angle
   - Analysis with evidence
   - Network connections
   - Thesis and closing

8. DRAFT: Write a ~800 word draft with [CITATION NEEDED] placeholders. Match Zay's tone: thoughtful, engaged, charitable to peers.

9. VERIFICATION: List every factual claim that needs a source.

Tone: Confident but respectful. Charitable to peers. Let personal perspective emerge naturally, not forced.</pre>

        <p>Open your new Gem and share the peer post you're responding to. You can paste the post text directly, or share the URL:</p>

        <p><strong>After the summary, the Gem asks about your angle:</strong></p>

        <pre>Gem: "What domain expertise or personal knowledge do you bring? What's your equivalent of Zay's sports fan perspective?"

You: "I know a lot about gaming — both video games and tabletop RPGs. I'm interested in how randomness works in games versus in real prediction markets."</pre>

        <p><strong>The Gem generates thesis options:</strong></p>

        <blockquote>
          Option A (Build): Caleb's right that prediction markets aggregate knowledge, but they work better for games with known rules than for real-world events with hidden variables.<br><br>
          Option B (Challenge): Prediction markets mistake "information aggregation" for "prediction" — the same way video games mistake high-score leaderboards for skill measurement.
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>You choose and refine:</strong></p>

        <pre>I like Option B. Can you help me develop the gaming analogy? I'm thinking about RNG (random number generation) in games and how players complain about "unfair" randomness.</pre>

        <pre>Who else in the network has written about prediction, randomness, or uncertainty?</pre>

        <p>The Gem might not know your specific classmates, but it will prompt you:</p>

        <blockquote>
          I don't have access to your class dashboard, but think about:<br><br>
          - Who has written about AI prediction or automation?<br>
          - Who has discussed the limits of data-driven decision-making?<br>
          - Who has a contrasting view you could engage with?<br><br>
          Check the dashboard and let me know who you'd like to reference.
        </blockquote>

        <pre>Gabriel Bell wrote about the "Consumption Paradox" and how predictions about AI abundance might be wrong. Tom Bishop wrote about boxing and how stats can't capture "heart."</pre>

    <h2>What the Gem Gave You</h2>

    <p>At the end of this workflow, you have:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A fair summary of your peer's argument</li>
      <li>A clear thesis connected to your personal expertise</li>
      <li>A structured draft with network connections</li>
      <li>A verification checklist before publishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What the Gem Didn't Give You</h2>

    <p>The Gem cannot:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Verify that quotes are accurate (you must check)</li>
      <li>Know what other classmates have written (you tell it)</li>
      <li>Make your argument for you (you choose the thesis)</li>
      <li>Write in your voice (you revise for authenticity)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p><strong>The draft is a starting point.</strong> Zay's actual post has his distinctive voice — the faith references, the sports enthusiasm, the specific Super Bowl moment. The Gem gets you to structure; you bring it to life.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Customizing for Your Style</h2>

    <p>If your posts tend to be different from Zay's, modify the Gem instructions:</p>

    <h3>If you're more academic:</h3>
    <pre>Tone: Formal, analytical. Use precise language. Avoid first-person anecdotes.</pre>

    <h3>If you're more personal:</h3>
    <pre>Tone: Conversational and personal. Lead with my own experience before engaging the peer's argument.</pre>

    <h3>If you want shorter posts:</h3>
    <pre>8. DRAFT: Write a ~600 word draft...</pre>
