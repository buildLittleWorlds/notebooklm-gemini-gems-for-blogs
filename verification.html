    <!-- SLOGAN BANNER -->
    <div class="slogan-banner">
      <span class="main-slogan">Save your sources. Own your thinking.</span>
      <span class="subtext">AI can help you research and draft — but your argument stays yours.</span>
    </div>

    <!-- PAGE TITLE -->
    <h1 class="page-title">Verification</h1>

    <!-- LEAD PARAGRAPH -->
    <p class="lead">AI can help you find and organize sources, but you own the accuracy. Here's how to verify AI-assisted work before publishing.</p>

    <h2>The Fluency Problem</h2>

    <p>AI generates confident-sounding text. This is called <strong>fluency</strong> — the text reads smoothly, uses proper grammar, and sounds authoritative. But fluency is not accuracy.</p>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p><strong>The danger:</strong> Because AI output "sounds right," we're tempted to trust it without checking. This is the "fluency illusion" — mistaking smooth prose for verified truth.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Your course has discussed this concept: "grasping a coherent mechanism" that doesn't actually exist. AI can construct a mechanism that <em>feels</em> coherent but isn't grounded in reality.</p>

    <h2>What Can Go Wrong</h2>

    <h3>Hallucinated Sources</h3>
    <p>AI can invent sources that don't exist — fake studies, non-existent articles, fabricated quotes. These citations look real but lead nowhere.</p>

    <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> A source that's suspiciously perfect for your argument, with a title that exactly matches what you need.</p>

    <h3>Misrepresented Statistics</h3>
    <p>AI might cite a real source but misstate what it says. "40% of jobs will be eliminated" might actually be "40% of jobs will be affected in some way."</p>

    <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Statistics with no context (affected how? over what timeframe?).</p>

    <h3>Quote Drift</h3>
    <p>AI might paraphrase a quote so much that it no longer reflects what the person actually said, or combine multiple quotes into one.</p>

    <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Quotes that sound too perfect or too convenient.</p>

    <h3>Outdated Information</h3>
    <p>AI's training data has a cutoff date. It might cite old statistics, reference defunct organizations, or miss recent developments.</p>

    <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Claims about "current" or "recent" events with no specific dates.</p>

    <h2>The Verification Workflow</h2>

    <div class="step-card">
      <span class="step-number">1</span>
      <span class="step-title">List Every Factual Claim</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>Go through your draft and mark every statement that could be verified or falsified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statistics and percentages</li>
          <li>Quotes attributed to people</li>
          <li>Claims about what studies or reports say</li>
          <li>Historical facts or events</li>
          <li>Descriptions of how things work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're unsure whether something is a factual claim, mark it anyway.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step-card">
      <span class="step-number">2</span>
      <span class="step-title">Check: Do I Have a Source?</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>For each factual claim, ask: "Where did this come from?"</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>If you added it yourself:</strong> You should have a source</li>
          <li><strong>If AI added it:</strong> You need to verify it exists</li>
          <li><strong>If it's common knowledge:</strong> Consider whether your reader would agree it's common knowledge</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step-card">
      <span class="step-number">3</span>
      <span class="step-title">Verify Sources Exist</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>For each source AI mentioned, search for it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google the title exactly as written</li>
          <li>Search for the author + organization</li>
          <li>Check the organization's website directly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you can't find a source after a reasonable search, assume it doesn't exist.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step-card">
      <span class="step-number">4</span>
      <span class="step-title">Check What Sources Actually Say</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>Once you find the source, read it yourself. Verify:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does it say what AI claims it says?</li>
          <li>Is the statistic accurate? In context?</li>
          <li>Are quotes exact or paraphrased?</li>
          <li>Is the interpretation fair?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI often gets the gist right but the details wrong. The details matter.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step-card">
      <span class="step-number">5</span>
      <span class="step-title">Fix or Remove Problems</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>When you find an error:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Correctable:</strong> Fix the claim to match the actual source</li>
          <li><strong>Source doesn't exist:</strong> Remove the claim or find a real source</li>
          <li><strong>Source says something different:</strong> Update your argument or find a source that supports your actual point</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't keep a claim just because it sounds good. Accuracy beats eloquence.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>NotebookLM vs. Gems: Verification Differences</h2>

    <h3>NotebookLM: Grounded but Limited</h3>

    <p>NotebookLM only answers based on sources you provide. This is safer — but with caveats:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> Answers cite your sources, so you can check them</li>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> Won't invent sources it doesn't have</li>
      <li><strong>Caution:</strong> Still might misinterpret what sources say</li>
      <li><strong>Caution:</strong> Discover Sources feature finds real sources, but you still need to evaluate their credibility</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p><strong>Verification with NotebookLM:</strong> When it cites a source, click the citation number to see the passage. Check that the passage actually supports the claim.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Gems: Powerful but Ungrounded</h3>

    <p>Gems generate from training data unless you give them sources. This means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Can invent sources, statistics, and quotes</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> May blend real information with fabrications</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use [CITATION NEEDED] placeholders in your Gem instructions</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Always run verification step before publishing</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p><strong>Verification with Gems:</strong> Treat every factual claim as unverified until you check it yourself. The Gem doesn't know what's true — it knows what sounds true.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Specific Things to Verify</h2>

    <h3>Statistics</h3>
    <table class="tool-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Claim Type</th>
          <th>What to Check</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>"40% of jobs are exposed to AI"</td>
          <td>Find the original report. What does "exposed" mean? Is it 40% exactly?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"Studies show that..."</td>
          <td>Which studies? By whom? Published where? When?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"Research indicates..."</td>
          <td>This is often a red flag for AI vagueness. Get specific.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <table class="tool-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Claim Type</th>
          <th>What to Check</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Direct quotes from people</td>
          <td>Search for the exact quote. Is it attributed correctly?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Quotes from peer posts</td>
          <td>Check the actual post. Did they say exactly that?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Paraphrased positions</td>
          <td>Does the paraphrase fairly represent what they said?</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Claims About AI and Technology</h3>
    <table class="tool-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Claim Type</th>
          <th>What to Check</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>"AI can/cannot do X"</td>
          <td>This changes rapidly. Check recent sources.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"Companies are doing X"</td>
          <td>Find a specific example. Name the company.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"The consensus is..."</td>
          <td>Whose consensus? Among whom? Is there actually consensus?</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>The "Could I Defend This?" Test</h2>

    <p>For every claim in your post, ask yourself:</p>

    <blockquote>
      If someone challenged this claim in class, could I point to a source and explain why it's true?
    </blockquote>

    <p>If the answer is no, either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find a source that supports it</li>
      <li>Qualify it as your opinion ("I believe..." / "It seems likely...")</li>
      <li>Remove it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When AI Verification Helps</h2>

    <p>You can use AI to help with verification — but you still need to do the final check:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask NotebookLM:</strong> "Does [source] actually say [claim]? Quote the passage." — Then read the passage yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask a Gem:</strong> "What claims in this draft need verification?" — Then verify each one manually.</li>
      <li><strong>Search with AI:</strong> Use Gemini to help find sources — then check that the sources exist and say what AI claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout insight">
      <p><strong>The verification loop:</strong> AI can help you identify what needs checking. But the final "yes, this is accurate" judgment is always yours.</p>
