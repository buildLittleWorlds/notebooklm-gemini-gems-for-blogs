    <h2>Output Quality Problems</h2>

    <h3>"The draft sounds too generic"</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> AI-generated drafts often sound the same — proper but bland.</p>

    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Add voice instructions:</strong> In your Gem, describe your actual writing voice. "I use contractions. I sometimes start sentences with 'But' or 'And.' I'm slightly sarcastic."</li>
      <li><strong>Use your own opening:</strong> Write the first paragraph yourself, then ask AI to continue matching that style.</li>
      <li><strong>Request specifics:</strong> "Give me three different ways to phrase this opening, from most formal to most conversational."</li>
      <li><strong>Plan to revise:</strong> Treat the draft as raw material, not final product. Read it aloud and change anything that doesn't sound like you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>"The summary misrepresents my peer"</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> AI summaries sometimes miss nuance or accidentally strawman.</p>

    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask for quotes:</strong> "Summarize their argument using their own words. Quote at least two key phrases."</li>
      <li><strong>Request steelman:</strong> "Give me the most charitable interpretation of their argument."</li>
      <li><strong>Check against the source:</strong> Read the AI summary, then re-read the peer post. Would your peer agree with how they're represented?</li>
      <li><strong>Ask your peer (if possible):</strong> "Does this fairly capture what you were saying?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>"I can't tell what's verified and what's not"</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Draft mixes sourced claims with AI-generated claims.</p>

    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use placeholders from the start:</strong> Tell your Gem: "Mark every factual claim with [VERIFY] until I confirm it."</li>
      <li><strong>Color-code your draft:</strong> In Google Docs, highlight everything you haven't personally verified. Don't publish until all highlights are removed.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep a verification log:</strong> For each claim, note: source, whether you checked it, what you found.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Workflow Problems</h2>

    <h3>"This is taking longer than just writing myself"</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Learning new tools has a startup cost.</p>

    <p><strong>Reframe:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first post with these tools will be slow. By the third or fourth, you'll have reusable notebooks and Gems.</li>
      <li>The time you spend now on verification saves you from embarrassing errors later.</li>
      <li>If a particular workflow isn't helping, simplify. Use only the parts that add value.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Minimal viable workflow:</strong> If the full process is overwhelming, try just NotebookLM for research OR just a Gem for outlining — not both. Add complexity as you get comfortable.</p>

    <h3>"I'm not sure if I'm using AI ethically"</h3>

    <p><strong>The key questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Is the thesis mine?</strong> Did I choose what to argue, or did I just accept AI's suggestion?</li>
      <li><strong>Can I defend every claim?</strong> If asked about any part of the post, can I explain it?</li>
      <li><strong>Did I verify?</strong> Is everything sourced and checked?</li>
      <li><strong>Does it sound like me?</strong> Would friends recognize my voice?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you can answer "yes" to all four, you're using AI as a tool, not a replacement for your thinking.</p>

    <h2>Getting Help</h2>

    <h3>For tool-specific issues:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> <a href="https://support.google.com/notebooklm">Google NotebookLM Help</a></li>
      <li><strong>Gemini:</strong> <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini">Google Gemini Help</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For course-related questions:</h3>
    <p>Email Dr. Plate or bring questions to class. Technical problems with AI tools are a normal part of learning — you won't be penalized for asking.</p>

    <div class="callout insight">
      <p><strong>Remember the slogan:</strong> If it breaks, breathe. Then try again. These tools are meant to help, not frustrate. If something isn't working, simplify or try a different approach.</p>
